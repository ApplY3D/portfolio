# Hello!

My name is Dmitrii. In **2018** I have started developing in IT with Fronted. But it didnâ€™t go so far. I have brought these skills for years and in **2020** I needed a site to check all my tasks for university. I continued with Backend and made the first version of my Deskify spa. It was **NodeJS** + **Handlebars** + **MongoDB** stack. Next step was React. I have rebuilt the application on **MERN** stack.  

Deskify story started **16.04.20** with prototypes and frontend only onepage site.  
Next step was NodeJS. **01.02.20** the first version of working site was published.  
After that I took some days of rest.  
VK Fresh Code pushed me for start learn React. **18.05.2020** React version was published on https://deskify.ru
