# Hello!

My name is Dmitrii. In **2018** I have started developing in IT with Fronted. But it didn’t go so far. I have brought these skills for years and in **2020** I needed a site to check all my tasks for university. I continued with Backend and made the first version of my Deskify spa. It was **NodeJS** + **Handlebars** + **MongoDB** stack. Next step was React. I have rebuilt the application on **MERN** stack.  

Deskify story started **16.04.20** with prototypes and frontend only onepage site.  
Next step was NodeJS. **01.05.20** the first version of working site was published.  
After that I took some days of rest.  
VK Fresh Code pushed me for start learn React. **18.05.2020** React version was published on https://deskify.ru  

In July 2020, I decided to try to get a job at Fora Soft as a Junior Fullstack JavaScript Developer. The task was to make a chat with call support on WebRTC. Well, I did it in about 3 days. Here is the code of the <a href="https://github.com/ApplY3D/react-socketio-webrtc-chat">final version</a>.
  
I was not hired for this position after an interview with a programmer, they said that I would have been hired in the winter, but now it's too early (like I need to improve my theory).  
  
I've been moving on in my JavaScript learning all this time. And in October 2020, I learned that KODE company is conducting an internship in Kaliningrad. Well, I realized that this is **the winning one**. On October 22, I start doing a test assignment for the position of Junior JavaScript Developer — an application that works with the Pokémon API for displaying, sorting, and viewing individual Pokemon cards. Here is the result (the full version with all the jokes can be viewed  <a href="https://apply3d.github.io">here</a> or the code on <a href="https://github.com/ApplY3D/kode-internship-test-task/tree/master/react-pokemon-api">github</a>):  
  
In mid-November, the internship started, and on December 25, I received an job offer. 
  
For all this time since April, I have watched ±20 courses (on the web). The series on the daily Web lesson (BUT one week was C++) lasts from June 24 to this day.
